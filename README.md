# Project Name: Kitten

## Description:
Kitten is a web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete kitten profiles. It also includes a JSON API for accessing kitten data.

It includes a form for creating and editing kitten profiles, with attributes of name, age, cuteness, and softness. The app also includes a JSON API for accessing kitten data, which can be accessed through a REST client.

Kitten was built with Ruby on Rails and utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store kitten information. The app includes a KittensController and routes for all 7 RESTful actions, as well as a flash hash for displaying success and error messages. The default route is set to kittens#index, which displays a list of all kittens. Users can view individual kitten profiles, create new kittens, edit existing kittens, and delete kittens through the app.
